Make a dictionary containing three major rivers and the country each river runs through. One key-value pair might be 'nile': 'egypt'.

Use a loop to print a sentence about each river, such as The Nile runs through Egypt.
Use a loop to print the name of each river included in the dictionary.
Use a loop to print the name of each country included in the dictionary.

dic = {'Nile':'Egypt','Amazon':'South America','SHN':'Shanghai'}
for river,country in dic.items():
    print(river,'runs through',country)
    print(".River -",river)
    print('.Location -',country)
    print('\n')
